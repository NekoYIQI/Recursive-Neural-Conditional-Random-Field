Introduction
This annotation dataset is firstly used in the paper 
"Recursive Neural Conditional Random Fields for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis". 

The annotations are made on the customer review dataset from SemEval Challenge 2014 Task 4 Subtask 1. 
The annotation from the challenge only contains aspect term labels. 
We create opinion term labels for the same customer review sentences.

Description
The annotation contains four files corresponding to customer reviews from two different domains for both training and testing. 
For training, one file contains opinion term annotations for 3044 training sentences for restaurant reviews, 
and the other file contains opinion term annotations for 3048 sentences for laptop reviews. 
(These reviews are the same as the ones in the challenge.) 
Each line in the annotation file lists all the opinion terms separated by ",". 
Each opinion term is followed by "+1" or "-1" indicating the opinion polarity. 
The order of the annotations is in line with the order of the original review texts for each domain. 
"NIL" indicates there is no explicit opinions for the corresponding review text.
